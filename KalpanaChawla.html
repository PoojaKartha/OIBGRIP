<p>
    <br>Kalpana Chawla was born in Karnal, India, on March 17, 1962. On February 01, 2003, she died when the Space Shuttle Columbia crashed during
    its re-entry to the earth.Kalpana studied at Punjab Engineering College, India, and graduated in 1982 with the Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical Engineer course.
    She took her master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas in 1984. She finished her Doctor of Philosophy degree in Aerospace Engineering 
    from the University of Colorado in 1988.<br>
    <br>Besides flying aerobatics and tail-wheel airplanes, Kalpana’s other interests are hiking, backpacking and reading. She received a posthumous Congressional Space Medal of Honor, 
    the NASA Space Flight Medal, and the Distinguished Service Medal. Kalpana, who was lovingly called Mantu by her parents, had shown extraordinary interest in flying. She was 
    three or four years old when she first saw an airplane on their rooftop flying above their house.<br>
    <br>Since then, her fascination with airplanes and flying became eminent. As a child, she always went with her father to a local flying club 
    and watch planes. While in school, her teacher said that Kalpana spends her free time making paper airplanes and flying them.
    Kalpana Chawla started working at NASA Ames Research Center in 1988. In 1993 Kalpana became the Vice President and Research Scientist of Overset Methods Inc. in Los Altos, California. 
    She formed a team with other researchers to simulate moving multiple body systems.<br>
    <br>She developed and implemented an efficient technique to perform aerodynamic optimization. Kalpana’s works are documented and being used in conferences and journals.
    Her dedication to her profession has made her be recognized and earned her higher positions at NASA.<br>
    <br><br>In 1995, she was selected as an astronaut candidate in the 15th Group of Astronauts in the Johnson Space Center. She completed a year of training assigned at the Astronaut Office EVA/Robotics and Computer Branches.
    In 1996, Kalpana began her work as a prime robotic arm operator and specialist on the STS-87.
    In 1998, she became a crew representative for shuttle station flight crew equipment, then became a lead officer in the Astronaut’s Office’s Crew Systems and Habitability section.
    She had recorded a total of 30 days, 14 hours, and 54 minutes in space during her job at STS-87 (1997) and the ill-fated STS-107<br><br>
    <br><br><strong><italic>Kalpana’s death was not in vain because several doors of opportunities have been opened for others aspiring to follow in her footsteps. She will be remembered as the first Indian woman who did not let her 
    racial origin hinder her from setting foot in space.</italic></strong>
